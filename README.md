### 📚 About Me in More Than 30 Secs

I worked in public health for five years, and I am now making a transition into remote data analytics. Although successful in my sanitarian career, I have realized the aspects of my work I find most rewarding are all in data-related functions. In order to further these pursuits I have recently completed Google's [Data Analytics Professional Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/ba29f2b0-aa38-4fea-88ff-939849fd5686/linked_in_profile), several courses on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/jeremyraby), and am building a project portfolio to document my learning. Check back often as I'm adding repos left and right!

I'm currently seeking opportunities in data analytics, so if you'd like to work together, feel free to connect via LinkedIn or contact me directly at jeremy.r.raby@gmail.com!
